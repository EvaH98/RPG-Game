<h1>Kill Bill: RPG Edition</h1>

Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill volumes 1 and 2 hold a special place in my heart, so much that I've watched the two films more times than I can count.

I decided to watch the movies again while I did this assignment and I though "I'm gonna make this game's theme Kill Bill!"

So that's what the theme is! Kill Bill!

<h1>The Rules</h1>
<p>1.Choose a character from the list of available characters, once you've chosen your character all others will move to the enemies list.</p>
<br>
<p>2.From the enemies list, choose which enemy you want to attack first, once you've chosen your enemy it will move to the defender area.</p>
<br>
<p>3. Using the attack button, attack the enemy in the defender area until either your HP is gone or the enemy's HP is.</p>
<br>
<p>4. If the inital enemy's HP is drained, pick a new enemy from the enemy list and repeat step 3.</p>
<br>
<p>5. If you defeat all enemies, congradulations, you won.</p>
<br>
<p>6. If you get defeated, sorry you lost!</p>
